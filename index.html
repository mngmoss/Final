            This website explores Geert van Kesteren's journey through
            <span id="target-word">Iraq</span> in 2003-2004 during the height of
            the US invasion and man hunt for Saddam Hussain. We aim to highlight
            and reveal the inaccuracies of those times and look at the true
            intentions of the war. The images in this book speak volumes,
            addressing the nature of war and those who endure it, civilians and
            soldiers, the living and the lost, but especially the faces of the
            future, the children. Explore this webpage and reveal information as

        <h5>Why Mister,</h5>
        <h5>Why?</h5>
        <h1>
          FOREWORD The dramatic images of the destructive attack on Iraq and the
          fall of the hated regime of Saddam Hussein are etched into our mind's
          eye. Iraq dominated the news for months, led to unbridge- able
          political contradictions, and elicited vehement reactions all over the
          world.
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-text">
          East and West, millions of people demonstrated against war. Yet
          worldwide, millions of people were also concerned about the oppression
          in Iraq and about the threat of new weapons and new terror attacks. In
          the meantime, Iraqis feared to fall victim to violence once again: to
          the violence of war, chaos and oppression.
        </h2>
        <h1>
          More than one year later, the people of Iraq still know no peace. The
          rejoicing about the fall of Saddam Hussein was short-lived. The damage
          to international relations still has not been repaired. Uncertainty
          and fear still hold civilians and political leaders in their grip the
          world over.
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-1">
          The Iraqi people has faced many ordeals. She was subjected to a cruel
          dictatorship and suffered from crippling economic sanctions. She
          survived many wars imposed upon her. An imposed liberation changed
          into a hated occupation in the eyes of many. Iraqis still have no
          voice. And it is Iraqis who are still paying the highest price: with
          the loss of loved ones, with the destruction of their country, and
          with insults to their national dignity. The result has been fear and
          anger, despair and bitter disappointment.
        </h2>
        <h1>
          Politicians and concerned citizens who stood against war and
          oppression stand a lot to learn from the questions and answers
          presented by the Iraqi people. After years of being gagged, Iraqis
          must be returned their voice and future. Politicians and concerned
          citizens the world over should now heed their calls for peace and
          justice.
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-2">
          The photographs of Geert van Kesteren bring alive the experience of
          common Iraqis, confronted with uncommon violence. His photo- graphs
          prompt us to look through the eyes of the people of Iraq, and listen
          to the voice of the Iraqi people. It is only then that those respon-
          sible to protect the innocent against war and oppression can
          contribute to an Iraq as envisioned by Iraqis.

        <h1>
          The text discusses the tragic events surrounding the 1992 uprising
          against Saddam Hussein's regime in southern Iraq, focusing on the
          account of Iskandar Jawad Witwit, the Mayor of Hilla. After the Gulf
          War, prompted by calls from then-American President George H.W. Bush,
          both Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south rose against Saddam's
          oppressive rule. However, the U.S. failed to support the rebellion,
          allowing Saddam to regain control, resulting in mass killings of
          civilians. In Hilla and neighboring Al Mahawil, thousands were
          executed and buried in mass graves, while U.S. military helicopters
          watched without intervening.
        </h1>
        <h1>
          The brutal suppression of the uprising marked a devastating chapter in
          Iraq's history, with an estimated 250,000 lives lost during Saddam
          Hussein's regime. This account underscores the broken promise of
          international support and the tragic consequences of the failed
          uprising, shedding light on the suffering of innocent civilians,
          including women, children, and the disabled. It also highlights the
          geopolitical complexities and the profound impact of international
          decisions on the lives of those caught in the midst of conflict and
          turmoil.

          The Iraqis have been searching for missing family members among the
          bones, skulls and clothing of the excavated skeletons in Al Mahawil
          for four days already. An excavator digs a hole in the ground and then
          volunteers haul out the bones with their bare hands. Everyone is doing
          their best, but in fact they are just doing something. I see a young
          man who is helping them walk past with a skull in his hands. He
          doesn't know to which skeleton it belongs.
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-3">
          In the end he just puts down the skull with any old stack of bones.
          The remains are then crammed into a plastic bag. Sometimes people find
          an identity card in the pockets of the cloth- ing, but often there is
          nothing. There are people who believe they can recognize their missing
          son from the brand of cigarettes that he smoked.

          Usually they find nothing, but sometimes you hear loud screaming and
          wailing somewhere, or you see someone fall faint: a son, daughter or
          grandchild has been found.

        <h5>Massacred on</h5>
        <h5>Holy Day</h5>

        <h1>
          Outside, near the wall of the shrine in Karbala, you can hear men and
          women wailing in despair. Even after more than 1300 years, the Shiites
          still mourn the brutal killing of Imam al-Hussein, grandson of the
          prophet Mohammed. During processions, men beat their breasts with
          their hands while they chant his name. On the final day of Ashoura
          they make an incision on their heads with a sword and then beat the
          wound so that the blood flows freely. This is how they express their
          enduring readiness to sacrifice their own blood for Hussein.
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-4">
          It is around midday when I hear five dull thuds. I run towards where
          they came from. A policeman suddenly grabs me from behind. He is in a
          fury. In the distance I see something that looks like a bomb attack. A
          militiaman runs at me yelling and whacks me in the face, which I can
          half duck. Another man pulls at my camera. I resist and get a thump in
          the stomach. Then the man loads his Kalashnikov. A crowd of people
          start getting involved, which makes the situation even more
          complicated. 'Calm, calm, friend,' I call out in Arabic. I just got
          here. No photo, no photo. Peace.' The armed man smashes the barrel of
          his gun straight into my lens.
        </h2>
        <h1>
          Then, out of nowhere, a massive man walks up. He seizes me in an
          armlock and drags me away from the excited masses. Twenty metres on he
          whispers in my ear: 'I am your friend.' He says that he comes from
          Iran. Once we are a long way off he lets me free, gives me a big wink
          and says: 'Bye bye.' He quickly takes a left, and I go right. There
          are also bomb explosions in Baghdad. The total number of fatalities
          exceeds 200. The attention in the Western media was massively
          overshadowed by that for the bomb attacks in Madrid nine days later,
          in which a similar number of people lost their lives.

          The blackest day for the UN, Kofi Annan called it. It was the day when
          everything changed in Iraq. The day when civilians became the target
          of terrorists. The day when journalists and employees of NGOs (non-
          governmental organisations) lost their independence, their immunity.
          It is the day of the attack on the UN headquarters, the Canal Hotel in
          Baghdad. Sergio Vieira de Mello was in charge of the UN mission. An
          independent UN mission to help Iraq become a country unified, a
          mission to keep a watchful eye on the behaviour of the Americans, a
          mission to help with reconstruction.

          Until August 19, 2003, when the driver of a cement-mixer truck with
          1,500 pounds of explosives parked below the window of UN
          representative De Mello's office.
        </p>
        <h1>
          When the truck exploded, 22 people died, including De Mello. A day
          later I visit friends who work for Unicef. There is a cloud of utter
          despair. The usually so energetic and pugnacious Iraqi, Ban Dhahi,
          stares straight ahead and doesn't utter a word. Her Canadian colleague
          Chris Klein-Beckman has died. Spokesman Geoffrey Keele has been facing
          the media for days. He steadfastly relates the story of the attack and
          UN policy, time and again. But when the cameras stop rolling, Geoffrey
          looks around confused. 'I've got to get out of here. To a tropical
          island, I want to drink myself into oblivion for two weeks. And once
          the hangover clears, then I need two weeks to think about my life. I
          have never seen Geoffrey, who lived with his wife in Baghdad, in Iraq
          again, and the Unicef office is still closed. The build- ing is
          surrounded by massive concrete blocks and men with bullet- proof vests
          and Kalashnikovs.

          It seemed like it would be wonderful for the men from the 4th Infantry
          Brigade when they moved into this majestic palace of Saddam's murdered
          son. Úday, the sadistic playboy, most certainly had a good time there.
          The palace stands on a high rock above the river Tigris and, so the
          gardener says, was used as a brothel. Former servants say that Uday
          sometimes chartered a whole airplane of whores from Russia. Beneath
          mile-high chandeliers in marble rooms there are enormous four-poster
          beds where the American soldiers found dozens of dildos when they
          moved in. But Dildo Palace, as the soldiers call Uday's den of
          iniquity, has lost a lot of its lustre.

          bathe in the river. Some of them don't even take the trouble to remove
          their dirty socks and immediately fall asleep on their camp- beds in
          the smouldering heat.

          Bremer's bodyguards look tough and dangerous. They are athletically
          built men, armed to the teeth with machine guns, pistols and knives.
          They always wear a bulletproof vest and have an earpiece in their left
          ear. The highest authority in Iraq is the top target for terrorists
          and the Iraqi insurgency. This means he has even better protection
          than the American President. Even when Bremer goes to the toilet, ten
          metres from his office, he is accompanied by four men.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Paul Bremer is in a hurry, since America's new MacArthur only has five
          months to put Iraq on track, and then the Iraqis have to take the
          strain themselves. It's all go in Bremer's cramped office. 'Schedule,
          schedule, schedule - that is what I want,' calls out Bremer. He has
          already overseen 1,750 projects. Bremer is evidently a man with an
          unbelievable amount of factual knowledge. Whether it concerns the oil
          industry or the process of emancipation for women in Iraq, Bremer
          knows all the data and percentages by heart and corrects his employees
          in a friendly manner. Bremer, as brilliant as he is stubborn, decides
          at a moment's notice, without any hesitation. For amounts greater than
          US$ 100 million he needs Washington's rubber stamp. About three times
          a week he talks with Condoleezza Rice in the White House on the red
          telephone. He eats from a plastic plate next to his computer and he
          doesn't even have time to pour the can of soda into a glass.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Bremer lives in 'the castle' within a bell-glass. In an enclave with
          about 1,000 Americans, he lives a life isolated from Iraq in the
          'green zone'. If Bremer ever comes into contact with Iraqis then it is
          in his office or at prearranged and heavily guarded meetings. It is
          noteworthy that the Iraqis are terribly nice to him at these meetings,
          and they almost all want to pose for a photo with him. Luckily, Bremer
          still seems to have some sense of reality. If an Iraqi woman cheers
          him enthusiastically 'Iraqis like you Mr. Bremer!' - then Bremer
          replies with a snigger: 'Yeah, the ones that are not trying to kill
          me!'

          and handcuffed, to the Bradley armoured vehicle that will take them to
          an improvised prison. One of the men arrested at the hotel is bleeding
          heavily from his nose and mouth. 'He stumbled,' the soldiers say."
          Apparently there was nobody near him to catch him. Not a jot of
          sympathy. At first glance it looks like the man has a broken nose and
          has lost a tooth. Despite his agonizing pain, the man has to sit in
          the cramped Bradley, in a squat position and tightly handcuffed. It's
          true that the platoon's nurse, Doc, has placed a bandage on the man's
          head, but he doesn't lift another finger. While the man is driven off,
          a soldier says: "There, you Fedayeen asshole. That's wiped the smile
          off your face.'
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-5">
          In the wintry freezing cold, the six prisoners sit squatting and in
          handcuffs at the barbed-wire entrance to the prison on the base. Three
          men are barefoot and wear only their pyjamas. The 'jail' is a dusty,
          empty store. There are a hundred men sitting on a concrete floor. Only
          a few of them have a mattress. A biting wind blows through the high
          sliding doors that are standing wide open.
        </h2>
        <h1>
          Captain Brown's soldiers have seen just about everything: Saddam-
          Fedayeen, loyalists of the Ba'ath party, roadside bombs, mortar and
          grenade attacks and intensive shoot-outs with the Iraqi insurgency.
          Their own living conditions are abysmal. Survival is their first
          priority. As a group they have become so close that excesses usually
          go unpun- ished. 'What else could happen to us?' some of them ask.
          'Send us to Iraq as a penalty?"
        </h1>
        <h2 id="reveal-6">
          In the unbearable heat of August 2003 I was at another prison. It
          stank of piss and sweat. There were the prisoners, like animals in the
          dirt behind barbed wire, guarded by soldiers with cudgels. The
          commander thought it was a disgraceful scene, but he didn't know where
          else he could hold the detainees. Things could be worse, however. 'You
          should be there when I hand over these people to the base in Tikrit
          for questioning. Then the soldiers jab their boots in the prisoners'
          backs to yank the handcuffs as tight as possible around their wrists.
          I don't want to know what else is going on there.'
        </h2>
        <h1>
          It's the period when the atrocities in the Abu Ghraib prison were
          being perpetrated. Months later, in December, the US Secretary of
          Defense Donald Rumsfeld has the audacity to say that the prisoners in
          Iraq were treated 'very, very well'. The questions about the whys and
          wherefores of the war begin to sound louder and clearer, and no longer
          just in Iraq.

        <h1>
          Close by Fallujah, two of the American military's Apache helicopters
          fly low above our shabby truck for a few minutes - one just in front
          of us, the other just behind. You can almost touch them and you can
          make a tally of the munitions: rockets, grenades, rounds for the chain
          guns. We slow down and breathe a sigh of relief as the two dangerous
          'bees' fly on.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I call my contact 'Hassan' in Fallujah from the car. I stick the
          antenna of the satellite telephone through a chink in the window.
          Nobody stops on this road, because it is too dangerous. Today, Hassan
          is bringing me into contact with the insurgency.
        </p>
        <h1>
          I meet him at the agreed place. He gets in and has to surrender his
          passport and car keys. He will get them back if he brings me back safe
          and sound. Hassan and I get into a car where two unfamiliar men are
          sitting waiting. They belong to the local insurgency.
        </h1>
        <p>
          The two men get out of the car. After a couple of minutes they wave me
          into a building. Then three men come in, each of them dragging a jute
          sack. They have grenade launchers, RPGs, standard grenades and guns in
          them. The men pull balaclavas over their heads and don head- bands
          with a text from the Koran - including the man who was just so
          appreciative of the lingerie photo. They pick up the grenades, screw
          them into the rocket launcher and stare into the lens.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Four minutes later we hear helicopters fly over. Tense, the men
          listen, but the helicopters don't leave. They lay their weapons on the
          floor and grab me, frisking me and searching my camera bag. The
          helicopters fly over again. The militiamen take to their heels. I am
          pushed back into the car. We drive away cautiously. The man beside me
          is extremely nervous and is sweating like a pig. Fortunately I am
          escorted back to my car. Hassan gets back his passport and keys, and
          we drive back to Baghdad.

          During the Saddam years many intellectuals fled the country. Six
          thousand doctors went abroad and, according to the surgeon Quralsh al
          Kasim, not one of them has returned to help. Medies have a hard time
          in Iraq. New victims arrive every day.
        </h1>
        <p>
          The mortuary is full, every day. The pathologist Hassan Faisal Lazim
          says that 95 per cent of the victims are killed by a bullet: 20 per
          cent of the time by the coalition troops, otherwise among themselves.
          The police are completely ineffective. Everyone has a firearm. Before
          the war, the murder rate in Baghdad was about 75 per month. In August
          2003, 1200 people were killed in attacks, revenge killings and other
          disputes.

          It is 10:30 a.m., and Lazim has already performed 22 post- mortems.
          The surgeon takes a short break and sips on a cup of tea. 'Since the
          bomb attacks on the UN and the Red Cross, all the big aid
          organizations have left the country. Look at my hospital. What a load
          of old rubbish, what terrible equipment! While here it is a state of
          emergency every day. Nobody's life is safe in this country. Mine
          neither. Often I sleep with colleagues in the hospital. It is too
          danger- ous to walk on the street at night, even though I live only
          five minutes from the hospital.'

<div class="Otitle">Final Notice</div>
    <div class="outro">
      <p>War is a harrowing testament to humanity's darkest tendencies. It is a stark reminder of our capacity for violence, destruction, and suffering on a grand scale. The horrors of war are multifaceted, encompassing both the physical and psychological dimensions of conflict.</p>
      <p>One of the most immediate and gruesome aspects of war is the loss of life. Soldiers and civilians alike are thrust into the throes of violence, often with no control over their fate. The toll of death and injury is staggering, leaving families shattered and communities scarred. The brutality of war knows no bounds, as people are subjected to unimaginable pain and suffering.</p>
      <p>Beyond the physical toll, war leaves deep emotional wounds that may never fully heal. Post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression become lifelong companions for many who survive. The mental anguish endured by combatants and civilians, especially children, can be just as crippling as physical injuries.</p>
      <p>War also disrupts entire societies, causing displacement, famine, and economic devastation. It tears apart the social fabric, sowing seeds of hatred and vengeance that can persist for generations. The ravages of war poison the land, leaving it riddled with mines and toxins, affecting ecosystems and endangering lives long after the conflict has ended.</p>
      <p>In the modern age, technology has amplified the horrors of war. The destructive power of weaponry is unparalleled, capable of obliterating entire cities and causing irreversible environmental damage. Nuclear weapons, in particular, loom as the ultimate testament to humanity's potential for self-annihilation.</p>
      <p>War is a costly venture, both in terms of human lives and economic resources. Nations often divert vast sums of money from education, healthcare, and social programs to fund their military endeavors, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.</p>
      <p>In the face of these grim realities, it becomes essential to work towards peace, to prevent conflicts before they escalate into wars, and to find non-violent means of resolving disputes. Only by acknowledging the horrors of war can we strive for a world where diplomacy and cooperation are prioritized, and the devastating aspects of armed conflict are confined to history's darkest chapters.</p>
